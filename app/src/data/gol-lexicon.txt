%pattern-name%AK47 reaction
%pattern-description%The following reaction (found by Rich Schroeppel and Dave Buckingham) in which a honey farm predecessor, catalysed by an eater and a block, reappears at another location 47 generations later, having produced a glider and a traffic light. This is the basis of a very small (but pseudo) p94 glider gun found by Paul Callahan in July 1994, and was in 1990 the basis for the Dean Hickerson`s construction of the first true p94 gun. (This latter gun was enormous, and has now been superseded by comparatively small Herschel loop guns.)

%pattern-name%blinker ship
%pattern-description%A growing spaceship in which the wick consists of a line of blinkers. An example by Paul Schick based on his Schick engine is shown below. Here the front part is p12 and moves at c/2, while the back part is p26 and moves at 6c/13. Every 156 generations 13 blinkers are created and 12 are destroyed, so the wick becomes one blinker longer.

%pattern-name%boat-bit
%pattern-description%A binary digit represented by the presence of a boat next to a snake (or other suitable object, such as an aircraft carrier). The bit can be toggled by a glider travelling along a certain path. A correctly timed glider on a crossing path can detect whether the transition was from 1 to 0 (in which case the crossing glider is deleted) or from 0 to 1 (in which case it passes unharmed). Three gliders therefore suffice for a non-destructive read. The mechanisms involved are shown in the diagram below. Here the bit is shown in state 0. It is about to be set to 1 and then switched back to 0 again. The first crossing glider will survive, but the second will be destroyed. (In January 1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while setting it to 0. A MWSS is fired at the boat-bit. If it is already 0 then the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1 then the boat and the MWSS are destroyed and, with the help of an eater1, converted into a glider which travels back along exactly the same path that is used by the gliders that toggle the boat-bit.)

%pattern-description%(p2) Found by Simon Norton, May 1970. This is the fifth or sixth most common oscillator, being about as frequent as the pentadecathlon, but much less frequent than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar. But it`s surprisingly rare considering its small size.

%pattern-name%conduit
%pattern-description%Any arrangement of still lifes and/or oscillators which move an active object to another location, perhaps also transforming it into a different active object at the same time, but without leaving any permanent debris (except perhaps gliders, or other spaceships) and without any of the still lifes or oscillators being permanently damaged. Probably the most important conduit is the following remarkable one (Dave Buckingham, July 1996) in which a B-heptomino is transformed into a Herschel in 59 generations.

%pattern-name%converter
%pattern-description%A conduit in which the input object is not of the same type as the output object. This term tends to be preferred when either the input object or the output object is a spaceship.  The following diagram shows a p8 pi-heptomino-to-HWSS converter. This was originally found by Dave Buckingham in a larger form (using a figure-8 instead of the boat). The improvement shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter Leithner has since found (much larger) oscillators of periods 44, 46 and 60 to replace the Kok`s galaxy.

%pattern-name%Cordership
%pattern-description%Any spaceship based on switch engines. These necessarily move at a speed of c/12 diagonally with a period of 96 (or a multiple thereof). The first was found by Dean Hickerson in April 1991. Corderships are the slowest spaceships so far constructed, although arbitrarily slow spaceships are known to exist (see universal constructor). Hickerson`s original Cordership used 13 switch engines. He soon reduced this to 10, and in August 1993 to 7. In July 1998 he reduced it to 6. In January 2004, Paul Tooke found the 3-engine Cordership shown below.

%pattern-name%eater
%pattern-description%Any still life that has the ability to interact with certain patterns without suffering any permanent damage. (If it doesn`t suffer even temporary damage then it may be referred to as a rock.) The eater1 is a very common eater, and the term "eater" is often used specifically for this object. Other eaters include eater2, eater3, eater4 and even the humble block. (In fact the block was the first known eater, being found capable of eating beehives from a queen bee.) Another useful eater is shown below, feasting on a glider.

%pattern-name%eater1
%pattern-description%(p1) Usually simply called an eater, and also called a fishhook. Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by Bill Gosper in 1971.
%pattern-code%0$0-1$0-0$1-2$1-2$2-2$3-3$3

%pattern-name%eater2
%pattern-description%(p1) This eater was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s. Mostly it works like the ordinary eater (see eater1) but with two slight differences that make it useful despite its size; it takes longer to recover from each bite and it acts like an eater in two directions. The first property means that, among other things, it can eat a glider in a position that would destroy a fishhook. This novel glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and combined with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders along four different paths.

%pattern-name%eater2 variant
%pattern-description%The following eater2 variant (Stephen Silver, May 1998) can be useful for obtaining smaller bounding boxes. A more compact variant with the same purpose can be seen under gliderless.

%pattern-name%eater3
%pattern-description%(p1) This large symmetric eater, found by Dave Buckingham, has a very different eating action from the eater1 and eater2. The loaf can take bites out things, being flipped over in the process. The rest of the object merely flips it back again.

%pattern-name%eater4
%pattern-description%(p1) Another eater by Dave Buckingham, which he found in 1971, but did not recognize as an eater until 1975 or 1976. It can`t eat gliders, but it can be used for various other purposes. The four NE-most centre cells regrow in a few generations after being destroyed by taking a bite out of something.

%pattern-name%edge shooter
%pattern-description%A gun which fires its gliders (or whatever) right at the edge of the pattern, so that it can be used to fire them closely parallel to others. This is useful for constructing complex guns. Compare glider pusher, which can in fact be used for making edge shooters.

%pattern-name%factory
%pattern-description%Another word for gun, but not used in the case of glider guns. The term is also used for a pattern that repeatedly manufactures objects other than spaceships or rakes. In this case the new objects do not move out of the way, and therefore must be used up in some way before the next one is made. The following shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block factory whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator. (This gun is David Bell`s improvement of the one Bill Gosper found in July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright, 1990, and the block factory is Achim`s p144 minus one of its stabilizing blocks.)

%pattern-name%Fast Forward Force Field
%pattern-description%The following reaction found by Dieter Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they allow the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6 generations. A neat illusion. See also star gate. (Leithner named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his favourite science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.)

%pattern-description%Any oscillator used to delete some but not all of the spaceships in a stream. An example is the blocker, which can be positioned so as to delete every other glider in a stream of period 8n+4, and can also do the same for LWSS streams. Other examples are the MW emulator and T-nosed p4 (either of which can be used to delete every other LWSS in a stream of period 4n+2), the fountain (which does the same for MWSS streams) and a number of others, such as the p6 pipsquirter, the pentadecathlon and the p72 oscillator shown under factory. Another example, a p4 oscillator deleting every other HWSS in a stream of period 4n+2, is shown below. (The p4 oscillator here was found, with a slightly larger stator, by Dean Hickerson in November 1994.)

%pattern-name%frothing puffer
%pattern-description%A frothing puffer (or a frothing spaceship) is a puffer (or spaceship) whose back end appears to be unstable and breaking apart, but which nonetheless survives. The exhaust festers and clings to the back of the puffer/spaceship before breaking off. The first known frothing puffers were c/2, and most were found by slightly modifying the back ends of p2 spaceships. A number of these have periods which are not a multiple of 4 (as with some line puffers). Paul Tooke has also found c/3 frothing puffers.  The following p78 c/2 frothing puffer was found by Paul Tooke in April 2001.

%pattern-name%Garden of Eden
%pattern-description%A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in a wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since been constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971. This example was 9 x 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 x 122 example. The following shows a 12 x 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006, based on a 13 x 12 one found by Achim Flammenkamp in June 2004.

%pattern-name%glider
%pattern-description%(c/4 diagonally, p4) The smallest, most common and first discovered spaceship. This was found by Richard Guy in 1970 while Conway`s group was attempting to track the evolution of the R-pentomino. The name is due in part to the fact that it is glide symmetric. (It is often stated that Conway discovered the glider, but he himself has said it was Guy. See also the cryptic reference ("some guy") in Winning Ways.)

%pattern-name%glider-block cycle
%pattern-description%An infinite oscillator based on the following reaction (a variant of the rephaser). The oscillator consists of copies of this reaction displaced 2n spaces from one another (for some n>6) with blocks added between the copies in order to cause the reaction to occur again halfway through the period. The period of the resulting infinite oscillator is 8n-20. (Alternatively, in a cylindrical universe of width 2n the oscillator just consists of two gliders and two blocks.)

%pattern-name%glider duplicator
%pattern-description%Any reaction in which one input glider is converted into two output gliders. This can be done either by oscillators or by spaceships. The most useful glider duplicators are those with low periods.  The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple glider duplicating mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input glider stream comes in from the upper left, and the output glider streams leave at the upper and lower right. One of the output glider streams is inverted, so an inline inverter is required to complete the duplicator.

%pattern-name%gliderless
%pattern-description%A gun is said to be gliderless if it does not use gliders. The purist definition would insist that a glider does not appear anywhere, even incidentally. For a long time the only known way to construct LWSS, MWSS and HWSS guns involved gliders, and it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner constructed the first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).  The following diagram shows the p44 MWSS gun that Dieter Leithner discovered (in a somewhat larger form) in April 1997. This is the smallest known gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun. It is based on an important p44 oscillator discovered by Dave Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 sparker by Nicolay Beluchenko. Note that a glider shape appears in this gun for three consecutive generations, but always as part of a larger cluster, so even a purist would regard this gun as gliderless.

%pattern-name%glider pusher
%pattern-description%An arrangement of a queen bee shuttle and a pentadecathlon that can push the path of a passing glider out by one half-diagonal space. This was found by Dieter Leithner in December 1993 and is shown below. It is useful for constructing complex guns where it may be necessary to produce a number of gliders travelling on close parallel paths. See also edge shooter.

%pattern-name%glider synthesis
%pattern-description%Construction of an object by means of glider collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be arranged so that they could come from infinity - that is, gliders should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the initial arrangement.  Glider syntheses for all still lifes and known oscillators with at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham.  Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of spaceships, because these can be used to create corresponding guns and rakes. Many of the c/2 spaceships that are based on standard spaceships have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec. In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the Corderships (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies suggested that a 2c/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way perform the crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build a c/2 forward rake for the 2c/5 spaceship; this was the first example in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same direction as the rake but more slowly.  A 3-glider synthesis of a pentadecathlon is shown in the diagram below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as a surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three gliders would already be known.

%pattern-name%glider turner
%pattern-description%An reaction in which a glider is turned by an oscillator or a spaceship. In the former case, the glider turner is usually called a reflector.  Glider turners are easily built using standard spaceships. The following diagram shows a convoy which turns a forward glider 90 degrees, with the new glider also moving forwards.

%pattern-name%Herschel receiver
%pattern-description%A pattern found by Paul Callahan in 1996, as part of the first stable glider reflector. Used as a receiver, it converts two parallel input gliders (with path separations of 2, 5, or 6) to an R-pentomino, which is then converted to a Herschel by one of two known mechanisms (the first of which was found by Dave Buckingham way back in 1972, and the second by Stephen Silver in October 1997). The version using Buckingham`s R-to-Herschel converter is shown below.

%pattern-name%Herschel transmitter
%pattern-description%Any Herschel-to-glider converter that produces two gliders on parallel tracks which can be used as input to a Herschel receiver. If the gliders are far enough apart, a suitably oriented mirror image of the receiver will also work, the first glider triggers the receiver and the second glider deletes the extra beehive.  The following diagram shows a stable Herschel transmitter found by Paul Callahan in May 1997.

%pattern-name%infinite growth
%pattern-description%Growth of a finite pattern such that the population tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded. Sometimes the term is used for growth of something other than population (for example, length), but here we will only consider infinite population growth. The first known pattern with infinite growth in this sense was the Gosper glider gun.  An interesting question is, What is the minimum population of a pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman found that a switch engine could be stabilized by a pre-block in a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with infinite growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a century until Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell patterns with infinite growth. The following month he found the one shown below, which is much neater, being a single cluster. This produces a stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.

%pattern-name%metamorphosis
%pattern-description%An oscillator built by Robert Wainwright that uses the following reaction (found by Bill Gosper) to turn gliders into LWSS, and converts these LWSS back into gliders by colliding them head on.

%pattern-name%mold
%pattern-description%(p4) Found by Achim Flammenkamp in 1988, but not widely known until Dean Hickerson rediscovered it (and named it) in August 1989. Compare with jam. In terms of its minimum population of 12 it ties with mazing as the smallest p4 oscillator. But in terms of its 6x6 bounding box it wins outright. In fact, of all oscillators that fit in a 6x7 box it is the only one with period greater than 2.

%pattern-name%MWSS out of the blue
%pattern-description%The following reaction, found by Peter Rott in November 1997, in which a LWSS passing by a p46 oscillator creates a MWSS travelling in the opposite direction. Together with some reactions found by Dieter Leithner, and a LWSS-turning reaction which Rott had found in November 1993 (but which was not widely known until Paul Callahan rediscovered it in June 1994) this can be used to prove that there exist gliderless guns for LWSS, MWSS and HWSS for every period that is a multiple of 46.

%pattern-name%pentadecathlon
%pattern-description%(p15) Found in 1970 by Conway while tracking the history of short rows of cells, 10 cells giving this object, which is the most natural oscillator of period greater than 3. In fact it is the fifth or sixth most common oscillator overall, being about as frequent as the clock, but much less frequent than the blinker, toad, beacon or pulsar.

%pattern-name%phase change
%pattern-description%A perturbation of a periodic object which causes the object to skip ahead by one or more phases. If the perturbation is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change the period of the object. An example of this, found by Dean Hickerson in November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the period of the oscillator would be 7 if the mold were removed, but the period is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes caused by the mold`s spark.

%pattern-name%puffer
%pattern-description%An object that moves like a spaceship, except that it leaves debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill Gosper and travelled at c/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for the very first one, found in 1971). Not long afterwards c/12 diagonal puffers were found (see switch engine). Discounting wickstretchers (which are not puffers in the conventional sense), no new velocity was obtained after this until David Bell found the first c/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Since then c/5 orthogonal puffers have also been found, the first by Tim Coe in May 1997. Jason Summers built the first c/4 orthogonal puffer in January 1999, and the first 2c/5 orthogonal puffer in February 1999. Hartmut Holzwart built the first c/4 diagonal puffer (as opposed to a wickstretcher) in February 2004.

%pattern-name%puffer train
%pattern-description%The full name for a puffer, coined by Conway before any examples were known. The term was also applied specifically to the classic puffer train found by Bill Gosper and shown below. This is very dirty, and the tail does not stabilize until generation 5533. It consists of a B-heptomino (shown here one generation before the standard form) escorted by two LWSS. (This was the second known puffer. The first is shown under puffer.)

%pattern-name%puff suppressor
%pattern-description%An attachment at the back of a line puffer that suppresses all or some of its puffing action. The example below (by Hartmut Holzwart) has a 3-cell puff suppressor at the back which suppresses the entire puff, making a p2 spaceship. If you delete this puff suppressor then you get a p60 double beehive puffer. Puff suppressors were first recognised by Alan Hensel in April 1994.

%pattern-name%pulse divider
%pattern-description%A mechanism that lets every n-th object that reaches it pass through, and deletes all the rest, where n > 1 and the objects are typically spaceships or Herschels.  The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original position. The small size and low period of this example make it useful for constructing glider guns of certain periods. p7, p22, p36 and p46 versions of this pulse divider are also known.

%pattern-name%reflector
%pattern-description%Any stable or oscillating pattern that can reflect some type of spaceship (usually a glider) without suffering permanent damage. The first known reflector was the pentadecathlon, which functions as a 180-degree glider reflector (see relay). Other examples include the buckaroo, the twin bees shuttle and some oscillators based on the traffic jam reaction. Glider guns can also be made into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.  In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider reflectors. The p8 version is shown below. Replacing the figure-8 by the p6 pipsquirter gives a p6 version. A more complicated construction allows a p5 version (which, as had been anticipated, soon led to a true p55 gun - see Quetzal). And in August 1999 Elkies found a suitable p7 sparker, allowing the first p49 oscillator to be constructed.

%pattern-name%relay
%pattern-description%Any oscillator in which spaceships (typically gliders) travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below using two pentadecathlons. Pulling the pentadecathlons further apart allows any period of the form 60+120n to be achieved - this is the simplest proof of the existence of oscillators of arbitrarily large period.

%pattern-name%Schick engine
%pattern-description%(c/2 orthogonally, p12) This spaceship, found by Paul Schick in 1972, produces a large spark (the 15 live cells at the rear in the phase shown below) which can be perturbed by other c/2 spaceships to form a variety of puffers. The diagram below shows the smallest form of the Schick engine, using two LWSS. It is also possible to use two MWSS or two HWSS, or even a LWSS and a HWSS.

%pattern-name%slide gun
%pattern-description%A gun which fires sideways from an extending arm. The arm consists of streams of spaceships which are pushing a pattern away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a different path.  Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994 (although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide guns using other reactions.)

%pattern-name%spacefiller
%pattern-description%Any pattern that grows at a quadratic rate by filling space with an agar. The first example was found in September 1993 by Hartmut Holzwart, following a suggestion by Alan Hensel. The diagram below shows a smaller spacefiller found by Tim Coe. See also Max. Spacefillers can be considered as breeders (more precisely, MMS breeders), but they are very different from ordinary breeders. The word "spacefiller" was suggested by Harold McIntosh and soon became the accepted term.

%pattern-name%spaceship
%pattern-description%Any finite pattern that reappears (without additions or losses) after a number of generations and displaced by a non-zero amount. By far the most natural spaceships are the glider, LWSS, MWSS and HWSS. For further examples see B29, big glider, brain, Canada goose, Coe ship, Cordership, crane, dart, dragon, ecologist, edge-repair spaceship, Enterprise, flotilla, fly, hammerhead, hivenudger, non-monotonic, Orion, puff suppressor, pushalong, quarter, Schick engine, seal, sidecar, snail, still life tagalong, sparky, swan, turtle, wasp, weekender and x66. See also Caterpillar.  It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all rational directions and at arbitrarily slow speeds (see universal constructor). Before 1989, however, the only known examples travelled at c/4 diagonally (gliders) or c/2 orthogonally (everything else). In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated searches to look for new spaceships, and had considerable success. Other people have continued these searches using tools such as lifesrc and gfind, and as a result we now have a great variety of spaceships travelling at twelve different velocities. The following table details the discovery of spaceships with new velocities.  A period p spaceship that displaces itself (m,n) during its period, where m>=n, is said to be of type (m,n)/p. It was proved by Conway in 1970 that p>=2m+2n. (This follows immediately from the easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)  The following diagram shows one of only two known c/5 diagonal spaceships. It was found by Jason Summers in January 2005.

%pattern-name%still life
%pattern-description%Any stable pattern, usually assumed to be finite and nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any pair of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore be an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes. For this reason a stricter definition is often used, counting a stable pattern as a single still life only if its islands cannot be divided into two nonempty sets both of which are stable in their own right. Compare pseudo still life.  The requirement that a still life not be decomposable into two separate stable patterns may seem a bit arbitrary, as it does not rule out the possibility that it might be decomposable into more than two. This is shown by the patterns in the following diagram, both found by Gabriel Nivasch in July 2001. On the left is a 32-cell pattern that can be broken down into three stable pieces but not into two. On the right is a 34-cell pattern that can be broken down into four stable pieces but not into two or three. (Note that, as a consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, four is as high as you need ever go.) It is arguable that patterns like these ought not to be considered as single still lifes.

%pattern-name%superstring
%pattern-description%An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one side so that it moves at the speed of light, often leaving debris behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively by Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)  Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a fuse which can be made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony Smithurst and uses tubs. (This is shown below. The superstring itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With the track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also be used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing this example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring track consisting of boats. At present these are the only two waveguides known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it moves along - it would be interesting to find one that remains intact.  See titanic toroidal traveler for another example of a superstring.

%pattern-name%transparent block reaction
%pattern-description%A certain reaction between a block and a Herschel predecessor in which the block reappears in its original place some time later, the reaction having effectively passed through it. This reaction was found by Dave Buckingham in 1988. It has been used in some Herschel conduits, and in the gunstars. Because the reaction involves a Herschel predecessor rather than an actual Herschel, the following diagram shows instead a B-heptomino (which by itself would evolve into a block and a Herschel).

%pattern-name%true
%pattern-description%Opposite of pseudo. A gun emitting a period n stream of spaceships (or rakes) is said to be a true period n gun if its mechanism oscillates with period n. (The same distinction between true and pseudo also exists for puffers.) True period n guns are known to exist for all periods greater than 61 (see My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators), but only a few smaller periods have been achieved, namely 22, 24, 30, 36, 44, 46, 48, 50, 54, 55, 56 and 60. (Credits for these small period guns are; p30, p46 and p60 by Bill Gosper in 1970-1971, p44 by Dave Buckingham in 1992, p50 by Dean Hickerson in 1996, p24 and p48 by Noam Elkies in 1997, p54 and p56 by Dieter Leithner in early 1998, p55 by Stephen Silver in late 1998, p22 by David Eppstein in 2000 and p36 by Jason Summers in 2004.)  The following diagram shows the p22 gun (David Eppstein, August 2000, using two copies of a p22 oscillator found earlier the same day by Jason Summers).

%pattern-name%tubstretcher
%pattern-description%Any wickstretcher in which the wick is two diagonal lines of cells forming, successively, a tub, a barge, a long barge, etc. The first one was found by Hartmut Holzwart in June 1993, although at the time this was considered to be a boatstretcher (as it was shown with an extra cell, making the tub into a boat). The following small example is by Nicolay Beluchenko (August 2005), using a quarter.

%pattern-name%twin bees shuttle
%pattern-description%(p46) Found by Bill Gosper in 1971, this is the basis of all known p46 oscillators, and so of all known true p46 guns (see new gun for an example). There are numerous ways to stabilize the ends, two of which are shown in the diagram. On the left is David Bell`s double block reaction (which results in a shorter, but wider, shuttle than usual), and on the right is the stabilization by a single block. This latter method produces a very large spark which is useful in a number of ways (see, for example, metamorphosis). Adding a symmetrically placed block below this one suppresses the spark. See also p54 shuttle.

%pattern-name%wickstretcher
%pattern-description%A spaceship-like object which stretches a wick that is fixed at the other end. The wick here is assumed to be in some sense connected, otherwise most puffers would qualify as wickstretchers.

This is shown below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following month.

%pattern-name%worker bee
%pattern-description%(p9) Found by Dave Buckingham in 1972. Unlike the similar snacker this produces no sparks, and so is not very important. Like the snacker, the worker bee is extensible - it is, in fact, a finite version of the infinite oscillator which consists of six ON cells and two OFF cells alternating along a line. Note that Dean Hickerson`s new snacker ends also work here.

%pattern-name%x66
%pattern-description%(c/2 orthogonally, p4) Found by Hartmut Holzwart, July 1992. Half of this can be escorted by a HWSS.

In fact this spaceship was found by a search with this restriction.
